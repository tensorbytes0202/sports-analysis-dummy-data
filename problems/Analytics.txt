| Type                     | Purpose              |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Perfect technique videos | Ground truth         |
| Average players          | Real-world variation |
| Faulty technique videos  | Error learning       |


2.2 Annotation (This makes or breaks the model)
You must label:
Bat swing phases
Foot positioning
Hip–shoulder separation
Head stability
Release point (bowler)

| Model          | Use                   |
| -------------- | --------------------- |
| MoveNet        | Fast, mobile-friendly |
| OpenPose       | Detailed joints       |
| MediaPipe Pose | Real-time             |
| **ViTPose**    | High accuracy         |
➡️ Output: 17–33 body keypoints per frame


3.2 Action Segmentation (Cricket-Specific)
Split video into:
Run-up
Load phase
Jump / stride
Release / swing
Follow-through

Models:
Temporal CNN
LSTM / GRU
Temporal Transformer

3.4 Technique Scoring Model

Two approaches:
Phase 1 (Rule + ML Hybrid)
Expert-defined biomechanical ranges
ML regression/classification
Phase 2 (Fully Deep Learning)
Graph Neural Networks on pose
Transformer-based scoring

🧪 4. Feedback & Improvement Engine
This is what coaches will PAY for.
Examples:
“Front foot landing early → reducing power”
“Excessive lateral head movement”
“Late hip rotation causing mistimed shots”


“Similarity / Confidence-based Evaluation System”
ya
“Model Confidence + Distribution Matching”
Matlab:
Model sirf prediction nahi kare
Balki ye bhi bataye:
“Ye naya video mere training data jaisa hai ya nahi”
//
Pose-Based Training (Foundation)
Tum kya extract karoge:
17–33 body keypoints (x, y, confidence)
Time sequence (frames)
//
Technique Embedding Model
Model seekhta hai:
“Perfect batting / bowling looks like this (numbers me)”
Model types:
LSTM / GRU
Temporal CNN
Transformer (later)


Phase 1 (2–3 months):
Sirf batting front-angle
1 shot type (cover drive)
20–30 clean training videos
Phase 2:
Similarity score
Confidence output
Phase 3:
Bowler add
Multiple angles

// Metrics
1.Bat Speed 🏏
✔️ YES (High Accuracy)
Kaise:
Bat ke handle + toe ka keypoint detect
Frame-to-frame displacement
FPS ke hisaab se speed calculate
Accuracy:
High-speed video (120fps): ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆
Normal video (30fps): ⭐⭐⭐☆

2.Head Position & Stability 🧠
✔️ YES (Very Accurate)
Kaise:
Nose / eyes keypoints
Horizontal & vertical movement tracking
Metrics:
Head deviation (cm / frames)
Head drop during swing
Head stillness score
Accuracy:
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Best metric from video)

3️⃣ Knee Position & Flexion 🦵
✔️ YES (High Accuracy)
Kaise:
Hip–knee–ankle angle
Front knee flexion timing
Metrics:
Max knee bend
Knee collapse detection
Over-flexion warning
Accuracy:
⭐⭐⭐⭐☆

4️⃣ Front Foot Movement 👟
✔️ YES (Very Accurate)
Kaise:
Ankle + toe keypoints
Foot landing timing
Distance & direction
Metrics:
Stride length
Late / early foot plant
Closed / open stance detection
Accuracy:
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

5️⃣ Reaction Time ⚡
⚠️ PARTIALLY POSSIBLE (Estimated)
Kaise (video-only):
Ball release frame detect
First bat / foot movement detect
Time difference = reaction time
Accuracy:
⭐⭐⭐☆☆
⚠️ Absolute milliseconds exact nahi, but comparative tracking very useful.

6️⃣ Body Weight Transfer ⚖️
✔️ YES (Indirect but Useful)
Kaise:
Hip center shift
Shoulder alignment
Front vs back leg load estimation
Metrics:
COM (center of mass) movement
Early / late weight transfer
Balance loss detection
Accuracy:
⭐⭐⭐☆
